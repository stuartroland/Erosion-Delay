# Erosion-Delay

Erosion Delay is a delay and chorus audio plugin created with JUCE in C++.
It is a simple but fully functional effect plugin complete with save/load functionality, preset functionality, a custom UI, and VU meters implemented from scratch.

I implemented this project in its entirety, though it is not entirely my own original design. I created it based in part off of plugins I worked with as part of the "Output Teaches Creating Audio Plugins with C++ and JUCE" multi-course online program.
